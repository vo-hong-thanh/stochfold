Stochfold is a library for predicting the folding of RNA. The library implements diffrent prediction algorithms:
  1) Zuker algorithm for MFE secondary structure prediction in thermodynamics.
  2) StochFold algorithm for folding kinetics.
  3) CostochFold algorithm and its improvement for contranscriptional folding.
